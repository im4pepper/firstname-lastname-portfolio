  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>My name is Jon, and I love visual communication. I became interested in graphic art when I was very young, however it didnâ€™t really dawn on me until I was a teenager. I am a graphic designer and I speak subliminally through visual communication. I studied art and graphic design at Utah State University and have been in the communication art industry for over 10 years.</p>
  <p>I draw inspiration from everywhere. I am always studying the shapes, colors, and typography of everything I see. I have a talent for seeing things that other do not.</p>
  <p>One more thing... I am a baseball junkie. I don't ever get tired of watching a game. I have pulled the car over before just to get out and watch a game in progress at the local baseball field. I attend as many professional baseball games as time permits. I am even the co-founder of a baseball related charity that focuses on sharing the joys of baseball with people living with disabilities or life threatening medical conditions.</p>

  <h1>Web Development</h1>
  <p>Web development was considered a computer science when I studied art at Utah State University, and therefore was taught as an extension of the computer science curriculum. I began self teaching web development almost as soon as I graduated college. Admittedly, the process was slow, and sometimes ugly. I have come a long way in web development since the Spring of 2005, and I proudly now call myself a web developer!</p>
